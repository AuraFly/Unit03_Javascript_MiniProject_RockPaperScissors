# Unit03_Javascript_MiniProject_RockPaperScissors
Building a rock paper scissors game via javascript

Followed along with Jay's video after a few attempts of trying on my own. Couldnt get it working, this looks very similar to Jay's but I added a few things, and used several else statements instead of the || option just because that is what I had in my logic before Jay went over things.

Thanks Jay!
